# server-side-apis-weather-dashboard

## Objectives

The purpose of this assignment was to create a program in javascript that will act as a weather dashboard. There is a search button allowing the user to search any city in the world. When searched the user will be provided with current weather infomation for the day as well as for the 5 days to come. Every time a city is searched a new button will be created below that will allow the user to search those cities once again. They are being saved into local storage.
